alucR - allocation of land use change 
=====

alucR - Project is a first step to implement a Land Use Change Model in R (http://www.r-project.org). We have been following the basic framework provided by Verburg et al. (2002). The flexibility of R and the large community of R users will make it easier to adapt the land use model to the users specific regional requirements.

## Main input requirement:
Current Land Use classification; Suitability maps for Land Use Classes; Protected Areas; Amount of pixels under a certain land use class for each scenario step (Demand)

## Output: 
Spatial explicit Raster Maps of the defined Scenario of land use change (for each year/modellingstep)

## Outlook
The current code provides a snapshot of the development and will further be updated and documented.
